# üçÉ Vaayu - Your Environmental Health Companion

**Your personalized environmental health companion for chronic conditions.**

Vaayu is a web application designed to help individuals, especially those with chronic health conditions, manage their environmental exposure and make informed decisions about their well-being. It securely connects your health profile with real-time air quality data, providing personalized recommendations at your fingertips.

## ‚ú® The Core Idea

In a world with increasing environmental health concerns, Vaayu empowers you to take control. Instead of storing your sensitive health data on a centralized server, Vaayu uses a decentralized approach. Your identity is managed by **Civic**, and your health profile is stored on the **Aptos blockchain** in a wallet that only you control. This ensures data privacy and sovereignty while enabling powerful, personalized insights.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **üîí Decentralized Identity:** Secure and simple login using Civic.
- **üîê User-Owned Data:** Your health profile is stored on the Aptos blockchain, giving you full control.
- ** wallets for each user.
- **üå¨Ô∏è Real-time AQI Monitoring:** Get the latest Air Quality Index (AQI) data for your current location.
- **‚ù§Ô∏è Personalized Recommendations:** Receive health advice based on real-time environmental conditions and your unique health profile.
- **üñ•Ô∏è Clean Dashboard:** A simple, intuitive interface to view your data and recommendations.
- **üèÜ Rewards System:** (Future) A system to reward users for actively managing their health.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1.  **Sign In with Civic:** The user authenticates their identity using the Civic mobile app, ensuring a secure and reusable digital identity.
2.  **Aptos Wallet Creation:** Upon first login, Vaayu automatically creates a new, personal Aptos wallet for the user, securely linked to their Civic ID.
3.  **On-Chain Health Profile:** The user completes an onboarding process, and their health data (chronic conditions, sensitivities, etc.) is stored as a resource on the Aptos blockchain via a smart contract transaction.
4.  **Personalized Dashboard:** The application reads the user's health profile from the blockchain and fetches real-time AQI data to display personalized alerts and recommendations on their dashboard.
